# Dedicated to (NUS) Computational Biology Majors Past, Present and Future

Inspired by [Notes to (NUS) Computer Science Freshmen, From The Future](https://github.com/nushackers/notes-to-cs-freshmen-from-the-future) which is created by CS seniors.

For those that are interested, can refer to this for the [full proposed idea](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lWbP5ij1G0cO4Or6l82mdSM4FcUxA6-QcMkWNcS6F6M/edit?usp=sharing) behind our CompBio GitHub organization.

## Intro

With yearly intakes averaging < 20 freshmen, the total number of CompBio students on campus ranges between 50-60. Back then, there were limited interaction within cohorts, not to mention across cohorts. Recognizing that there is no common platform for interaction, a bunch of us came together and started what is now called the Computational Biology Network (CBN). Special mention to the following for making it happen: Lakshimi, Jhoann, Ye An, Sheng Min, Wei Chin, Anuj, Jeffrey, Daniel and Joseph.

If you are/were in CompBio and would like to join our GitHub organization, do reach out to any core member or indicate your interest in the Intercon. Following which, feel free to create a pull request in any of our repo to contribute to it, and share it with other CompBio mates.

    * [Learning GitHub](https://github.com/NUS-Computational-Biology/Learning-GitHub) - Created as an introductory crash course to GitHub

* Good tips from the SoC document

    * Consider starting an open-source project.

    * Build your profile, write your blog using [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) with [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/) for free.

    * You may also apply for a *free* github student account, [check out here](https://github.com/edu), applying using your NUS account makes it easier to verify that youâ€™re really a student. Private repos are great for collaborating on school projects.

    * Hack for fun. Fun and pointless is better than unicorny and non-existent.

    * When in doubt, sketch out your problems. Diagram them. They'll usually be easier to break down and analyse after a few doodles. If that doesn't work, take a break.

    * Question *ALL* your assumptions! eg. Does 'x' really hold the value I think it does here?

    * Before coding a single line, question your own mental model of the problem. Do you understand the problem? Do you understand the desired outcome?

    * Know the rules first, then see how you can break them.
